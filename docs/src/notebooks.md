About the notebooks
==================
[Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) notebooks provide a great opportunity to put together code, text and graphics 
in a reproducible and accessible way. Therefore, the examples for this package are being  amended by a series of Pluto notebooks.
Like the example code, the notebook code is tested during CI.

The notebooks use an [updated and simplified](@ref #api-update) version of the VoronoiFVM API. 

Plese note, that in the html version, interactive elements like sliders are disabled. Navigation via the table of contents does work, though.
